        <p>Speaker's Forum SVCE oraganised an fun event at OAT atmosphere that pulled crowds to play under hilarious tension and tease their friends.
            The photo word connect game was the first event in the series that normally would test the person to guess the word that connects the picture. Staggering and fun crowds came to entertain themselves in this event. 
            The second event cracked everyone up and was lovely to watch how people could coordinate with their partner to enact famous poses. The final stage is the headphone game which was unexpected for us to get through the event without laughing at the gestures they make.The game idea to figure what was their partner enacting with headphones on playing random music is a different ball game but it never failed to get a crowd to spectate how the person gets it right.
            Funspace was the flagship event of SF for "Highways" which was conducted on 11th, 12th & 13th of May, 2023. It saw over 100 students in attendance.
